# exploring-tech

This is a web page I made for my Grade 12 Computer Science class.

## How to run

The web page is hosted [here](https://anshm42.github.io/exploring-tech/)

If that does not work however (Images/assets won't load), you can run it locally. You will need to have nodejs and npm installed.

Clone the repository. In the repository folder, run `npm i`. Once that command is done running, run `npm run dev` to start a development server and open the localhost link in a browser.
